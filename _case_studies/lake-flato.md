## Challenge

Ieso needed to prove their ability to create a world-class app to secure a deal with their first potential client in the US, a large insurance company.

Roughly 60% of users in the US were accessing therapy via Ieso’s website using their phones. To create a more convenient and helpful experience for both the patient and the therapist, Ieso needed to build a mobile app. It would have to duplicate the clinical environment already found on their website within six months. The relationship with their client and overall user adoption were both on the line, so the stakes were high.  Although they needed to build an app quickly, they did not yet have a dedicated in-house team of mobile developers.

## Solution

Ieso and thoughtbot began with a product design sprint, building a prototype that could be used to test and validate the new onboarding flow. Designers ran user interviews to identify any issues and address those concerns before development on the mobile app began.

thoughtbot continued to work with Ieso to build out the features that were identified through design sprints using React Native as a primary development framework. thoughtbot provided the mobile infrastructure that integrated the new patient onboarding flow with their existing back-end infrastructure.

## Outcome

The first version of the mobile app was created and delivered on time to customers in the US market, allowing Ieso to secure a deal with their first large industry client.

The success of the first design sprint also inspired Ieso to conduct multiple design sprints, each addressing different needs of their users.

Ieso’s current goal is to continue augmenting clinical insights for therapists to increase recovery rates for their patients. The mobile environment and passive data collection will lead to a better understanding of how Ieso can deliver real-time behaviour change to patients in their everyday life outside of therapy.

> “With any consulting company, there is usually some apprehension and disconnect between the teams, especially from the client’s perspective: whether the team is delivering, is there enough interaction, are we able to impart enough knowledge to them, etc. Over the course of the last year we have seen success with the thoughtbot team because of our collaboration around innovation, the cultural and technical alignment, mutual respect, and the deliverables.”
